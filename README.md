I'm Ricardo, and I'm a GSU pursuing my degree in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Application Development. Iâ€™m also a **Tech Fellow at CodePath.org**, assisting fellow students in strengthening their web development skills. I enjoy building applications, learning about cloud technologies, and working on projects that combine **software engineering** with **cloud services**.

### Currenlty Building ðŸª´âœ¨

Trying to build a full-stack applicaion focusing on developor workflow assistance using React front-end, Python with FastAPI backend, and Postgres in a docker container. What has been completed so far is implamenting the connection between both using Axios and user athenication with JWT, and setting the foundation of the Kanban Task Board and Snippet Manager.

### Completed: Improvements ðŸ’¾

BlockCloud: Adding more features for the Discord bot slash commands, limit user access for the server. Learn how to use terminal inside the EC2 instance and add/drop mods to the server.

### Hobies ðŸ§ŠðŸ”¨

I watch animes, read managa, big fan of JRGs like Final Fantasy (FFX is my favorite), and play my favorite gacha game: Arknights. Some goals I would love to do is travel to other countries (Japan, Europe), go back to working out and learn calisthenics, and draw.
